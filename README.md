CreativAI Suite
Full Movie Production Pipeline

I will integrate the Gemini 2.5 Flash text generation model for the Music and Video studios to provide realistic AI-generated metadata and scene descriptions, and I will implement the imagen-4.0-generate-001 model for the Poster design phase.

I've also added a functional "Project Bundle" download using document.execCommand for cross-browser compatibility within the frame.

I have successfully updated the CreativAI Suite to bridge the gap between prompt and production.

Key Enhancements:
AI Intelligence Integration: The "Music" and "Video" generation buttons now actually query Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate technical soundtrack metadata and cinematic scene descriptions based on your prompts, rather than just using static text.

Thematic Continuity: When you move from Music → Video → Poster, the app now uses the context generated in the previous step (e.g., the specific song title and technical style) to pre-fill the next prompt.

Live Visual Generation: The "Poster" phase is fully powered by Imagen 4.0, providing high-quality 3:4 aspect ratio film posters based on the entire creative history of your project.

Production Log: You can now see the specific names and metadata of generated assets in the sidebar as you work.

Simulated Distribution: The final screen includes "Bundle" and "Share" functions designed to simulate the final export of a media production.
